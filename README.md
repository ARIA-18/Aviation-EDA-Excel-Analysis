# Airline Pricing & Operations Analysis (Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on airline flight pricing and operational data to identify patterns in ticket pricing, route demand, booking behavior, and revenue contribution across airlines and travel classes.

The analysis focuses on understanding how airlines can optimize pricing strategies and operational decisions in a competitive market.

## ❓ Problem Statement
The airline industry operates in a highly competitive environment where pricing, flight frequency, route demand, and booking behavior directly impact revenue and market positioning.

Ticket prices are influenced by multiple factors such as number of stops, flight duration, time of travel, booking lead time, and service class. Without data-driven insights, airlines risk underpricing high-demand routes, mispricing premium services, or failing to compete on value-for-money offerings.

This project aims to analyze airline pricing and operational data to uncover actionable insights that support better pricing, revenue, and operational strategies.
